# Face_Detection_YOLOv8

The Face Detection project utilizes the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) architecture for high-performance face detection. YOLOv8 is an advanced object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. This project provides a pipeline for training, validating, and testing the YOLOv8 model specifically for detecting faces in images, videos, and live webcam feeds.

## Features
-Face Detection: Employs YOLOv8 for precise face detection.

-Training: Trains the model using 500 self-annotated images.

-Validation: Assesses the model's performance on a validation dataset.

-Testing: Tests the model on 150 images, videos, and live webcam feeds.


## Results 
After training the model for 20 epochs, the model demonstrates high accuracy in face detection, achieving an accuracy of 91.85%. This performance is confirmed by the confusion matrix, which provides detailed insights into the model's precision and recall. The confusion matrix and other relevant result files can be found in the results folder.

## Output 
The output folder contains images that have been processed using the model.
